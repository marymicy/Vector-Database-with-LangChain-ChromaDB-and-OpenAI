# Vector-Database-with-LangChain-ChromaDB-and-OpenAI

This project implements a persistent AI-powered document search system using LangChain, ChromaDB, and OpenAI to process and query PDF files. It reads and extracts text from multiple PDF resumes using PyPDF2, then converts the extracted text into vector embeddings with OpenAIEmbeddings. These embeddings, along with metadata (such as source file names and page numbers), are stored in a ChromaDB vector database for efficient retrieval. The database is persisted to disk, allowing it to be reloaded without reprocessing the documents. Using VectorDBQAWithSourcesChain, the system enables semantic search and question-answering, allowing users to query specific information—such as skills—from resumes. This setup is ideal for automated resume screening, intelligent document retrieval, and AI-powered knowledge management.
